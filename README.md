# vectormap

This browser based vector map application was made as a part of a bachelor's thesis for Metropolia University of Applied Sciences Land Surveying degree programme. A working demo can be found using [this link](http://users.metropolia.fi/~tuomati/). What follows is an abstract for the work. The full thesis work can be found [here](http://www.urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2019053113741).

> This bachelor’s thesis intended to analyse online topographic maps, their data structure and rendering methods, as well as to document the development of Vector Map, a webbased application for rendering a topographic map using vector graphics.

> The topographic elements and position data used in this thesis were obtained from an open database for topographic data. To automate the processing of the data, a program was developed to receive the topographic database map tile and output the code required by the Vector Map application for drawing a vector map.

> The thesis established that online maps utilizing vector graphics are still at their infancy since they require considerable processing power from the user end. To solve the problem, the processing power of average consumer hardware should improve.

> The results of this bachelor’s thesis can be used to develop vector-based map applications. Furthermore, the thesis offers an in-depth understanding of the National Land Survey of Finland’s database definitions and further processing of its data. The Vector Map application can also be expanded to a comprehensive online map service covering the whole Finland.
