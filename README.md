# vectormap

This browser based vector map application was made as a part of a bachelor's thesis work for Metropolia University of Applied Sciences Land Surveying degree programme. A working demo can be found using [this link](http://users.metropolia.fi/~tuomati/). What follows is an abstract for the work. A link to the full thesis work will be provided when it becomes available.

> Maps have been used by mankind as a visual representation of spatial data for millenia. Digitalization has brought maps for mobile devices and made them readily available for everyone. This bachelor’s thesis is an analysis of topographic maps, which are maps that describe topographic features in at a detailed level from lakes and seas to erratics and small paths.

> Every digital map service used today represent their data in raster image format. As our technologies and devices improve, alternative methods to draw maps have become possible. One such example is a vector map developed for this bachelor’s thesis that does not differ visually from raster map but utilizes vector graphics to draw the map.

> Since vector map is drawn on the user end, it enables dynamic features that are not available for traditional raster maps. Examples of such features are dynamically disabling the drawing of unnecessary map markers or calculating the path length directly using the data stored in the elements. Map legends that are often featured with raster maps could be made obsolete using vector maps to display contextual information when user interacts with objects.

> Topographic element and position data were obtained from the National Land Survey of Finland’s open database for topographic data. To automate processing of this data, a program was developed that receives the topographic database map tile and outputs the Javascript code required for drawing a vector map.

> Results of this bachelor’s thesis work can be used to help develop vector-based map applications. It can also be used if one wants to have an in-depth understanding of the National Land Survey of Finland’s database definitions and their further processing. The vector map demo that was developed for this bachelor’s thesis work can also be expanded to a full map service covering all of Finland.
